// No, the time displayed each time may not be exactly 1000ms. Although the `setTimeout` is set to 1000ms, the actual display time might slightly differ.

// ### Explanation:

var start = Date.now();
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('time passed: ', Date.now() - start, 'ms');
}, 1000);


// - The purpose of this code is to record the current time with `start`, then execute a callback after a delay of 1000ms (1 second), and display the time difference between `start` and the callback execution time.
  
// - **`setTimeout`** is asynchronous (non-blocking), meaning the callback function will execute after 1000ms. However, due to JavaScript's event loop mechanism (event loop mechanism), when the 1000ms passes, the callback function may not execute immediately. It will be placed in the task queue (task queue), waiting for the JavaScript main thread (main thread) to be idle to process it. Therefore, there may be a slight delay in the actual execution time.




// - **Specific situation**:
//   - Even if `setTimeout` is set to 1000ms, the execution of the callback function might have some additional delay because the event loop (event loop mechanism) and other tasks in the program may affect the trigger time of the callback.
//   - In systems with heavy load or many asynchronous operations, the callback execution time could be delayed by a few milliseconds.


// ### Conclusion:

// The displayed time should be close to 1000ms, but it is not guaranteed to always be exactly 1000ms. In practice, there may be small differences.
